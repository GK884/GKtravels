                If you are one of those folks who envy the USA for its Statue of Liberty or China for its Spring Temple
                Buddha Statue, then embrace yourself for an architectural marvel from India that has made it into the
                book of world records. Gujarat Tourism has made history by unveiling the world’s tallest statue, The
                Statue of Unity, located in the town of Kevadia.

                The 600 feet tall or 182 meters tall statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is located in Kevadia near the
                Narmada Dam in Rajpipla, and is one of the popular tourist attractions in Kevadia. Made of steel and
                bronze, the pride of Gujarat Tourism, the statue symbolises the message of unity Sardar always
                propagated.

                Dawning the skyline, the grand statue of Patel is believed to be a major tourist destination for
                international travellers and domestic tourists. Standing tall in the heartland of Gujarat, the statue
                symbolises the message of peace and unity that the man himself believed till his last breath.
